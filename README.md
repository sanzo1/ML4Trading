A collection of Python programs I wrote to use Machine Learning to do stock market analysis, as part of the CS7646 course at Georgia Tech.

* mc1p1_assess_portfolio: Performs statistical analysis of a diversified stock portfolio and graphs the results. Computes daily average rate of return, standard deviation of daily return, average period return, Sharpe Ratio, and portfolio end value. Plots and saves a graph into the Output folder. Leverages the Pandas and Numpy Python packages.
